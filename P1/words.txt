Take a trip inside my head
Leave your sticks and stones
Broken bones, I'm left for dead
But still I carry on
When I am down
I carry on
When it's cold in this wild, wild world
Everyone's trying to dig your grave
I carry on
When you're told you don't the fit the mold
Now everybody's got a say
I carry on
When the madness all around us starts to take it's toll
I carry on
It's a long, dark, winding road we're on
Oh, I carry on
Here I go again, the sound of silence
Ringing in my head
Same as yesterday, see the sirens
All I feel is red
I bet the house, don't make no sense
But all I got's what's in my chest
So here I go again
Here I go
But when I am down
I carry on
When it's cold in this wild, wild world
Everyone's trying to dig your grave
I carry on
When you're told you don't the fit the mold
Now everybody's got a say
I carry on
When the madness all around us starts to take it's toll
I carry on
It's a long, dark, winding road we're on
Oh, I carry on
I carry
I carry
I carry
I carry on
I carry
I carry
I carry
I carry on
When it's cold in this wild, wild world
Everyone's trying to dig your grave
I carry on
When you're told you don't the fit the mold
Now everybody's got a say
I carry on
When the madness all around us starts to take it's toll
I carry on
It's a long, dark, winding road we're on
Oh, I carry on
I carry on
Oh, I carry on
